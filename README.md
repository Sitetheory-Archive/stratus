[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sitetheory/stratus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sitetheory/stratus) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Sitetheory/stratus](https://badges.gitter.im/Sitetheory/stratus.svg)](https://gitter.im/Sitetheory/stratus?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Overview

This platform intends to bridge the gap between Web Design and Development in a fast, flexible environment.

## Goals

* Creative Design
* Elegant Simplicity
* Extensibility
* Optimal Performance

## Frameworks & Libraries

##### Dependent

* Underscore.js
* Backbone.js

##### Optional

* Require.js

## Usage

##### Overview

Core Types:

* Collection
* Model
* Router
* View
  * Plugin
  * Widget

##### Deployment

Stratus is built to run within a Require.js Asynchronous Environment with Promises.  For an independent implementation without Require.js, further functionality involving auto-loading dependencies will not be present, so these javascript dependencies and templates will need to be defined directly on the DOM. 

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```

##### Plugins

Plugins are simple objects that provide Design functionality to DOM elements, independent of a model or collection, which effectively removes all API support.

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```

##### Widgets

Widgets are complex objects that provide API and Design functionality to DOM elements, which include a model or collection for API support.

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```
