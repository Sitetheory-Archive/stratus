## Thesis

The Designer always comes first in the Stratus Layer.

## Goals

* Creative Design
* Code-Free Design
* Elegant Simplicity
* Abstract Extensibility
* Optimal Performance

## Frameworks & Libraries

##### Dependent

* Underscore.js

##### Recommended

* Require.js

##### Optional

* Angular.js
* Backbone.js
* React.js

## Usage

#### Deployment

Stratus is built to run within a Require.js Asynchronous Environment with Promises.  For an independent implementation without Require.js, further functionality involving auto-loading dependencies will not be present, so these javascript dependencies and templates will need to be defined directly on the DOM. 

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```
